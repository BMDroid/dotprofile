These are the various config files for the Manjaro i3, inclluding system settings and rice.

### Introduction

1. To prevent the screen tearing when using Chrome, create 20-intel.conf
2. The original audio control on the Manjaro i3 cannot find the analog output. Instead, we use pulseaudio and install the pulseaudio-bluetooth. To connect to the bluetooth audio devices automatically, the main.conf was edited.
3. Replace the bash to the zsh and install the on-my-zsh, with the zsh-autosuggestion plugin configured.
4. Rice the i3, including change the theme to the Arc-Dark and replace with the Paper Icons. 
5. Also, replace the default dmenu with the rofi.

This is a pull test.
